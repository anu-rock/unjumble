UnJumble
========

UnJumble is a simple, neat and fast Android app that unscrambles jumbled English words. And unlike other similar apps in the Play store, there is no character limit on the input jumbled words. UnJumble boasts of a collection of 58,000+ English words to search from stored effectively in a SQLite database.

I am planning to write a detailed article on building Android apps, with a beginner's perspective, using the latest API. I'll use UnJumble to demonstrate the various process involved in development and publishing of Android apps.
